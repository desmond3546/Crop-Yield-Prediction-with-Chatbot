# Crop Yield Prediction with Chatbot
Developed a predictive system using Python, Flask, HTML, and Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to estimate crop yield based on factors like soil type, rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer use. The system aimed to assist farmers and agricultural planners in making data-driven decisions to improve productivity and resource management.
Built an interactive AI-powered chatbot by integrating LangChain, Streamlit, and Google Generative AI APIs. The chatbot can handle dynamic queries, provide intelligent responses, and serve as a user-friendly interface for various applications, including agricultural assistance, FAQs, and general-purpose conversations.
